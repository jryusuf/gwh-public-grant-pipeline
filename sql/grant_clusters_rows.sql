intended to: Explore and expand course materials transformation to include the adoption, adaptation, and creation of Open Educational Resources (OER); the adoption of materials available through GALILEO and USG libraries; and the use of other no-cost and low-cost materials. Provide support and time to faculty instructors, librarians, instructional designers, and other professional staff to meet, plan, review, and implement these approaches. Work toward equitable access to materials and lower materials costs for students and contribute to their retention, progression, and graduation. Examples of grant projects include: Adopting an OpenStax Sociology textbook in place of a commercial textbook for Introduction to Sociology and creating new ancillary materials to support the adoption. Adapting existing Calculus OER to fit the learning outcomes of your particular course and then adopting these new materials in place of a commercial textbook. Creating new OER to adopt in place of a commercial textbook when there are no OER to cover the subject. Creating a Library Reading List to adopt in place of a commercial textbook when there are no OER to cover the subject. Adopting a low-cost homework or adaptive solution such as Lumen Learning’s Waymaker or OHM, OpenStax Partner courseware, or other low cost materials to ensure total required resource costs for students are under $40.00.', 'Affordable Learning Georgia', 'Faculty instructors, librarians, instructional designers, and other professional staff within the University System of Georgia or those involved with GALILEO.

Fellowship is a 12-month hybrid leadership program for social entrepreneurs around the world. They accelerate leaders who relentlessly tackle the most pressing social issues to create a more sustainable and just future for all. Each leader receives professional executive coaching, c-suite business mentorship, $10,000 to spend exclusively on their leadership development, customized tools, resources, training and networking opportunities to scale their social impact. They take a holistic approach to create change by building resilient, competent and successful leaders through the hybrid Fellowship. Fellows raise 3x the capital in service of social change because of the opportunities afforded by the program. This includes: 360° Assessment, Executive Coaching (Virtual), Business Mentorship (Virtual), Annual Summit (in-person), Targeted Funds ($10,000 grant for leadership development), Peer and Subject Matter Expert Network.', 'Global Good Fund', 'The enterprise that the candidate leads is at least two years old. The enterprise must have at least one full-time employee in addition to the candidate. The applicant is committed full-time to running their enterprise. Applicants should not be currently receiving formal coaching/mentoring support; if they are applying for other fellowships within the 2026 fellowship cycle, please make sure it is indicated within your application. The applicant must be in a position where they have primary decision-making authority. Additional Consideration: The enterprise the candidate is leading can be a for-profit, non-profit, or hybrid. The enterprise’s scope of work can be international, domestic, or both. The enterprise has developed an effective business model and is therefore well positioned (or can provide evidence that demonstrates a high level of potential) to scale in the long term. The enterprise addresses issues in the following sectors: Financial Inclusion, Environment, Education, Economic Mobility, and Health. However, we will consider applicants who fall outside of these areas as related to their potential for social impact and systemic change.'), ('9bb63204-b133-44f8-8700-df3e8abdccdd', '2025-07-30

social and environmental issues that define our time. From climate action and education access to health equity and economic inclusion, young leaders are building solutions that matter. If you are aged between 18 and 30 and are leading a project or startup with a focus on social impact, the Global Innovation Challenge 2025 is your opportunity to accelerate your work and access critical resources to scale your impact. This challenge is more than a competition. It is a launchpad for young impact-driven founders to connect, learn, and grow. By applying to this initiative, you not only gain access to funding but also to a global community of change agents and experienced mentors dedicated to supporting youth-led innovation. The Global Innovation Challenge is a global call to action for young founders who are leading projects or startups aimed at solving pressing social or environmental problems. The initiative is designed to supercharge innovative, high-potential ventures led by young people. Whether your project is in its early stages or gaining traction, this challenge offers both the funding and support structure to take your initiative further. Selected applicants will be eligible for multiple grant awards, with funding ranging from $3,000 to $15,000 USD. A single submission makes you eligible for several funding streams, significantly increasing your chances of support. Beyond financial assistance, all finalists will receive free access to project development resources, a pitch coach, and exclusive learning materials to strengthen their initiatives and presentation skills. This program is about unlocking the potential of youth by equipping them with the tools and opportunities to thrive. It is open to applicants from all continents and does not restrict participation based on nationality, educational background, or organizational status. All that is required is a demonstrated commitment to social impact and a scalable, solution-oriented idea.', 'Social Shifters', 'Individuals aged 18–30.

last-resort auctions in the 2012 New gTLD Program. This program will make a difference in the Internet ecosystem, while also positively impacting people all over the world by investing in creative and innovative solutions that further ICANN's vision of a single, open, and globally interoperable Internet. The types of initiatives that the ICANN Grant Program will fund include those that support ICANN's mission by: Benefitting the development, distribution, and evolution of the services and systems that support the Internet's unique identifier systems. Providing capacity development. Advancing developments, innovation, and open standards for the benefit of the Internet community. Contributing to diversity, participation, and inclusion across stakeholder communities and geographic regions. All proposed activities also must not duplicate existing activities currently or previously funded by ICANN. The total net auction proceeds fund amounts to $217 million as of 30 June 2023 and are segregated from ICANN's general Operations. This may not be the final amount of proceeds available for distribution, as a portion of the auction proceeds funds under management are still subject to disputes. Additionally, costs to run the program will be covered by the auction proceeds fund. The Grant Program will operate in a series of cycles. During each cycle, a portion of the total fund will be available for distribution for successful applications. The maximum project duration is 24 months. The total amount available for grants in this first cycle is $10 million. Applications can be submitted for grant awards between $50,000 and $500,000. These award thresholds are for the first cycle only and will be reassessed for future cycles.', 'Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)', 'To be eligible applicants must: Be a charitable organization.

In partnership with local community partners, Innovia annually identifies a Community Grants funding theme. While we are committed to funding projects across all our impact areas, when possible, we will prioritize proposals that align with the annual theme. This year’s theme is Youth Engagement, with an aim to increase opportunities for young people to participate in community events and activities that build relationships and decrease isolation.', 'Innovia Foundation', 'In order to be eligible, applicants must be a public charity with tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; a federally recognized tribe; or a public entity such as a school district, municipality, or unincorporated group or association.
